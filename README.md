# Python for Scientific Programming
Welcome to my repository which contains Python and MATLAB scientific scripts and reports that perform the following:

* Data Fitting
* Data Smoothing
* Linear Systems
* Orthogonal Basis Functions (Chebyshev Polynomials)
* Random Number Generation (with multithreading)

Hope you find them useful!

## Getting Started
You'll need MATLAB to run most of the exercises.
